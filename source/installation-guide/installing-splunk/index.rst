Installing Splunk
=================

This guide describes the installation of a Splunk infrastructure comprised of a Splunk Enterprise instance as indexer and a Splunk Forwarder node.
In addition to Splunk Enterprise components, you will also find the instructions to install and configure the Wazuh app for Splunk.

These are the two main components in a common Splunk architecture:

- **Splunk Forwarder:** Runs in the Wazuh manager and Wazuh API instance. It sends alerts to the Splunk Indexer.
- **Splunk Indexer**: Runs the Splunk engine. It reads, parses, indexes, and stores alert data generated by the Wazuh server.
